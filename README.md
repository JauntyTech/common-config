# Computer Configuration (Common)

This repository contains configuration files (bashrc, vimrc, gitconfig...), fonts, scripts, and guides for setting up a development environment on any operating system. It is a collection of things that we have found to be useful over the years. 


## Installation (Optional)

You can certainly clone this repo and use the files as you see fit. However, if you would like to have the environment setup automatically for your operating system, you can run `install.sh`, and it will take care of everything for you. We encourage you to take a look inside the script before running it to see what it does. Note that it does modify your `~/.bashrc` and `~/.vimrc` files (or creates them if they don't exist), to append a line that sources from this repository. 

Usage:
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/quantum-media-tech/common-config.git
cd common-config
./install.sh
```
